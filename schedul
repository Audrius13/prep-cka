### manually assign pod to node
set nodeName: <nodename> in pod.spec

### use selector to get pod by label
kubectl get po --selector app=App1

### annotations used for info only purpose
metadata.annotations

### selectors and labels in definitions
in rs and svc definition files spec.selector.matchLabels should have common label with pods label

### apply taint on node
kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect

taint-effect:
NoSchedule
PreferNoSchedule
NoExecute

### add tolerations to pod definition

spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "<taint key>"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "<taint key value>"
    effect: "<taint effect>"

### to check node taints
kubectl describe node <nodename> | grep -i taint

### assign pod to node in pod definition file
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large <---- label on node

### to label node
kubectl label nodes <node name> <label-key>=<label-value>

### configure affinity in pod definition file
# operators In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - antarctica-east1
            - antarctica-west1

### taints and tolerations could be used together to restrict other pods to land on node
# taints and tolerations does not guarantee pod will not be deployed on other nodes

### resources request and limit
spec:
  containers:
  - resources:
      requests:
        memory: "4Gi"
        cpu: 2
      limits:
        memory: "8Gi"
        cpu: 4
      
### set limitrange per container in namespace
kind: LimitRange
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    max:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: 1Gi
    min:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 500Mi
    type: Container

### set quota per namespace
kind: ResourceQuota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: 4
    requests.memory: 4Gi
    limits.cpu: 10
    limits.memory: 10Gi

### DaemonSet definition file is same as ReplicaSet, only kind differs

### to create static pod on standalone server with bubelet
Place pod definition file to /etc/kubernetes/manifests
It's defined in kubelet service as --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests or --config=file.yaml and in file.yaml look for staticPodPath

### to specify different scheduler in pod definition file
spec:
  schedulerName: my-custom-schedul

### to view events 
kubectl get events -o wide

### scheduler profiles
in pod definition
spec:
  priorityClassName: high-priority  <--- first priorityclass need to be created

scheduler first ad pod to "scheduling queue" then "filter" and then "score" and then "bind" to deploy pod
filter is to filter nodes that can run pod
score nodes based on free resources
